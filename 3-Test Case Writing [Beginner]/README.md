A **test case** is a document which consists of a set of conditions or actions which are performed on the software application in order to verify the expected functionality of the feature.
The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within a system are peforming as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements.
The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system.
## Why Test Cases are so important?
Test cases define what must be done to test a system, including the steps executed in the system, the input data values that are entered into the system and the results that are expected throughout test case execution. Using test cases allows developers and testers to discover errors that may have occured during development or defects that were missed during ad hoc tests. 
The benefits of an affective test case include: 
- **Guaranteed good test coverage**
- **Reduced maintenance and software support costs**
- **Reusable test cases**
- **Confirmation that the software satisfies end-user requirements**
- **Improved quality of software and user experience**
- **Higher quality products lead to more satisfied customers**
- **More satisfied customers will increase company profits**
