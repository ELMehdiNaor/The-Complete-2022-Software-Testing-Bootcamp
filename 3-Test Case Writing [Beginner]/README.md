A **test case** is a document which consists of a set of conditions or actions which are performed on the software application in order to verify the expected functionality of the feature.
The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within a system are peforming as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements.
The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system.
