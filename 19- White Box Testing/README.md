## What is White Box Testing
**White box testing** is a testing technique which evaluates the code and the internal structure of a program. **White box testing**
involves looking at the structure of the code. When you know the internal structure of a product, tests can be conducted to ensure that 
the internal operations performed according to the specification. 

## What do you verify in White Box Testing ?
**White box testing** involves the testing of the software code for the following: 
- Internal security weaknesses
- The flow of specific inputs through the code
- Expected output 
- Whether conditional loops function correctly
- Individual testing of each function, statement and object
- Broker or poorly structured paths in the coding processes

## White Box Testing Techniques
There are a variety of techniques you can use to accomplish **white box testing**, including:
- **Statement coverage:** it is the method of validating wheter each and every line of the code is executed at least once.
- **Decision coverage:** **decision** in a programming language is like the **IF statement**. An **IF statement** has two bracnhes: **True** and **False**.
  So in **decision coverage** we validate whether each decision is executed at least once.
- **Path coverage:** tests all the paths of the program. This is a technique which ensures that all the paths of the program are traversed at least once.
  This techniques is used for complex programs.
  
 ## How do you perform White Box Testing ?
 This is what testers do when testing an application using the **white box testing** technique: 
 - **Understand the source code:** the tester has to learn and understand the source code of the application, the tester must be very knowledgeable in the 
  programming languages used in the application they are testing. Also, the testing person must be highly aware of secure coding practices.
 
 - **Create Test Cases and execute:** the second step involves testing the application's source code for proper flow and structure. The testing person will 
    develop little tests for each process or series of processes in the application and execute them.
