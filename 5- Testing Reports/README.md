## What is a Test Report?
A **Test Report** is an organized summmary of testing objectives, activities, and results. It is created and used to help stakeholders
(product manager, analysts, testing team and developers) understand product quality and decide whether a product, feature or a dfect resolution is on track for release.
## Types of Testing Reports
### Test Progress Report
To track the progress of more than one test plan or test suite, use the Progress Report. It helps you track the team's progress with respect to planned testing of your product or service by answering the following questions:
- **How much testing is complete?**
- **What is the current status how many tests have passed, failed or are blocked?**
- **Is the testing likely to complete in time?**
- **What is the rate of execution on a daily basis?**
- **Get a breakdwon by test plan and suite to understand where execution is going slow or has many failed or blocked tests**
- **View the progress each suite has made within a test plan and identify the areas that need attention** 

## Test Summary Report
A **Test summary report** is a test document that formally summarizes the results of all testing. The purpose of this document is to enable Project management and Customer to know
the status of testing, status of the project and application quality level. 
A **Test summary report**: 
- **can be generated for every software release**
- **It should have metrics, charts and table forms, if possible**
- **It has to summarize all test activities based on Quality work products**
