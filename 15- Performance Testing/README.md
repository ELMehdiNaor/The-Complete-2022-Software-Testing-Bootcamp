## What is Performance Testing ?
Performance testing is **non-functional** software testing technique, that ensures software applications to perform properly 
under their expected wordload. It is a testing technique carried out to determine system performance in terms of sensitivity, 
reactivity and stability under a particular workload. 

## Why do Performance Testing ? 
The goal of performance testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Bottlenecks are a single point or
component within a system's overall function that holds back overall performance. Performance testing can be used to help identify
the nature or location of a software-related performance problem by highlighting where an application might fall or lag, it can also
verify that a system meets the specifications claimed by its manufacturer or vendor.

## Types of Performance Testing
There are many types of testing methods that can be used to determine performance. Some examples are as follows: 
- **Load Testing:** measures system performance as the workload increases. That workload could mean concurrent users or transactions.
    The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
- **Stress Testing:** is meant to measure system performance outside of the parameters of normal working conditions (under extreme conditions). 
    The objective is to identify the breaking point of an application. 
- **Spike Testing:** it tests the system's reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by the users. The workloads are substantially increased
  increased quickly and repeatedly. The workload is beyond normal expectations for short amounts of time.
- **Endurance Testing:** is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period of time. 
- **Scalability Testing:** is used to determine if software is effectively handling increasing workloads. This can be determined by gradually adding to the
  user load or data volume while monitoring system performance. It helps plan capacity addition to your software system. 
 - **Capacity Testing:** determines how efficiently software performs with large projected amounts of data. The objective is to check
   product's performance under varying database volumes.
   
## Performance Testing process

The specific steps of performance testing will vary from one organization and application to the next. Nevertheless, the general goals of performance testing are largerly the same across the board so there is a certain workflow most testing plans will follow: 

- **Identify the Test Environment and Tools:** identify the production environment, testing environment, and testing tools at your disposal. Document the hardware, software, infrastructure specifications and configurations in both test and production environments to ensure coherence. 
- **Define Performance Criteria:** determine the constraints, goals and thresholds that will demonstrate test success. The major criteria will be derived directly from the project specifications, but testers should be adequatly empowered to set a wider set of tests and benchmarks.
- **Plan and Design Tests:** think about how widely usage is bound to vary then create test scenarios that accommodate all feasible use cases. Design the tests accordingly and outline the metrics that should be captured.
- **Configure Test Environment:** configure the testing environment before you execute the performance tests. 
- **Run Tests, Analyze and retest :** consolidate and analyze test results. Share the findings with the project team. Repeat the test to confirm each problem has been conclusively eliminated. 

## Example Performance Test Cases
- Verify response time is no more than 4 seconds when 1000 users access the website simultaneously
- Verify response time of the Application Under Load is whitin an acceptable range when the network connectivity is slow
- Verify response time of the Application under low, normal, moderate and heavy load conditions
- Check the maximum number of users that the application can handle before it crashes
- Check database execution time when 500 records are read/written simultaneously
- Check CPU and memory usage of the application and the database server under peak load conditions

## Performance Test Tools 
There are a wide variety of performance testing tools available in the market. The tool you choose for testing will depend on many factors such as types of the protocol supported, license cost, hardware requirements, platform support etc. Below are some of the most popular used testing tools: 

- **JMeter:** one of the leading tools used for load testing of web and application servers
- **HP Loadrunner:** is the most popular performance testing tools on the market today. This tool is capable of simulating hundreds of thousands of users, putting applications under real-life loads to determine their behavior under expected loads. **L0oadrunner** features a virtual user generator which simulates the actions of live human users.
