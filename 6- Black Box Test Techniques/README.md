## What is Black Box Testing ?
**Black box testing** Black box testing involves testing a system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings. 
A tester provides an input, and observes the output generated by the system under test.
This makes it possible to identify how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, its response time, usability issues and reliability issues.

## Black Box Testing Advantages and Drawbacks
|  Advantages  |  Drawbacks  |
|  ----------  |  -----------| 
|Testers do not require technical knowledge, programming or IT skills|Difficult to automate|
|Testers do not need to learn implementation details of the system|Requires prioritization, typically infeasible to test all user paths|
|Tests can be executed by crowdsourced or outsourced testers|Difficult to calculate test coverage|
|Low chance of false positives|If a test fails, it can be difficult to understand the root cause of the issue| 
|Tests have lower complexity, since they simply model common user behavior|Tests may be conducted at low scale or on a non-production-like environment|

## Types of Black Box Testing
Black box testing can be applied to three main types of tests: **functional**, **non-functional** and **regression testing**

### Functional Testing
**Black box testing** can test specific functions or features of the software under test. For example, checking that it is possible to log in using correct user credentials, and not possinle to log in using wwrong credentials.

**Functional testing** can focus on the most critical aspects of the software (smoke testing/sanity testing),  on integration between key components (integration testing), or on the system as a whole (system testing). 

### Non Functional Testing
**Black box testing** can check additional aspects of the software, beyond features and functionality.  A non-functional test does not check “if” the software can perform a specific action but “how” it performs that action.

**Black box tests** can uncover if software is:
- **Usable and easy to understand for its users**
- **Performant under expected or peak loads**
- **Compatible with relevant devices, screen sizes, browsers or operating systems**
- **Exposed to security vulnerabilities or common security threats**

### Regression Testing
**Black box testing** can be used to check if a new version of the software exhibits a regression, or degradation in capabilities, from one version to the next. Regression testing can be applied to functional aspects of the software (for example, a specific feature no longer works as expected in the new version), or non-functional aspects (for example, an operation that performed well is very slow in the new version).

## Black Box Testing Techniques
### Equivalence Partitioning
Testers can divide possible inputs into groups or “partitions”, and test only one example input from each group. For example, if a system requires a user’s birth date and provides the same response for all users under the age of 18, and a different response for users over 18, it is sufficient for testers to check one birth date in the “under 18” group and one date in the “over 18” group.

### Boundary Value Analysis
Testers can identify that a system has a special response around a specific boundary value. For example, a specific field may accept only values between 0 and 99. Testers can focus on the boundary values (-1, 0, 99 and 100), to see if the system is accepting and rejecting inputs correctly.

### Decision Table Testing
Many systems provide outputs based on a set of conditions. Testers can then identify “rules” which are a combination of conditions, identify the outcome of each rule, and design a test case for each rule.

For example, a health insurance company may provide different premium based on the age of the insured person (under 40 or over 40) and whether they are a smoker or not. This generates a decision table with four rules and up to four outcomes—below is an example with three possible outcomes.

|  Conditions  | Rule 1 | Rule 2 | Rule 3 | Rule 4 | 
|  :--------   | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Under 40 | False | False | True | True |
| Smoker | False | True | False | True | 
| **Outcomes** |    |    |    |    | 
| High premium |    |    |    |  x  | 
| Medium premium |  x  |  x  |    |    | 
| Low premium |    |    |  x  |    |  

In this case four use caes (one for each rule) would be sufficient to fully test the system

### State Transition Testing
In some systems, significant responses are generated when the system transitions from one state to another. A common example is a login mechanism which allows users to authenticate, but after a specific number of login attempts, transition to a different state, locking the account.

If testers identify a state transition mechanism, they can design test cases that probe the system when it transitions states. For example, for a system that locks the account after five failed login attempts, a test case can check what happens at the sixth login attempt.
