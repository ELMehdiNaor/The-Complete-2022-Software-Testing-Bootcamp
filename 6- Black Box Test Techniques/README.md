## What is Black Box Testing ?
**Black box testing** Black box testing involves testing a system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings. A tester provides an input, and observes the output generated by the system under test.
This makes it possible to identify how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, its response time, usability issues and reliability issues.
