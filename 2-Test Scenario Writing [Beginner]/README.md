A **Test Scenario** is defined as any functionality that can be tested. It is also called **Test Condition**. As a tester, you should put yourself in the end user's shoes and figure out the real world scenarios and uses cases of the application under test.
## Why Write Test Scenarios?
**Test Scenarios** are created for the following reasons:
- **To ensure the completion of test coverage**
- **Validate that the software is working properly for each Use Case**
- **Improve the User Experience**
- **Identify the most important end-to-end transactions**
- **Study the terminal function and help to build test cases**
## How to create Test Scenarios?
As a tester, you can follow the following steps to create Test Scenarios:
- **Step1**: Carefully study the Requirement Document - Business Requirement Specifications (BRS),
             Software Requirement Specification (SRS), Functional Requirement Specification (FRS) pertaining to the                          System Under Test(SUT). 
- **Step2**: Isolate every requirement, and identify what possible user actions need to be tested for it. Figure out the                    technical issues associated with the requirement. Also, remember to analyze and frame possible system abuse                    scenarios by evaluating the software with a hacker's eyes.
- **Step3**: Enumerate test scenarios that cover every possible feature of the software. Ensure that these scenarios cover                  every user flow and business flow involved in the operation of the website or app.
- **Step4**: After listing the test scenarios, create a Traceability Matrix to ensure that every requirement is                              mapped to a test scenario.
- **Step5**:  Get the scenarios reviewed by a supervisor, and then push them to be reviewed by other 
              stakeholders involved in the project.
 ## Who and When write Test Scenarios? 
 Typically testers are the ones who are responsible for creating Test Scenarios. As Test Scenarios tell us what need to be       tested, therefore always written before test cases.
