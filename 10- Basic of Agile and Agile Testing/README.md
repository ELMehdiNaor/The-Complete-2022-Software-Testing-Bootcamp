# Basics of Agile and Agile Testing 
## What is Agile Software Development ? 
In order to understand **Agile testing**, it's important to understand what the **Agile development methodology** involves. It's an umbrella term, 
encompassing many practices that are quite different from traditional development techniques. As the name implies, an **Agile methodology**
is focused on reporting to change. There are many frameworks teams might use, such as **Scrum** or **Kanban**, but at the center of it is 
collaborative approach. 

A **traditional approach** might seperate team members based on the area they are working on, and slowly add pieces
together to create a finished product. With **Agile**, continuous integration is key - the whole team collaborates and new features are added
as they work. It creates a completely different software development life cycle - which is why teams need to implement agile testing methods
for help.

## What is Agile Testing ? 
**Agile testing** operates under the philosophy that continuous testing is a crucial part of development, on a par with coding. 
In Agile, testing is integrated directly into the development process so that bugs are discovered as early and as often as possible. 
As a result, testers can identify problems at every point in the development process, moving the product quickly towards release.

## The four Values of Agile

The **Agile Manifesto** consists of four key values: 
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan 

Let's take a look at each one in detail:

**1-Individuals and Interactions:** having the right group of individuals on your software team is vital to success. The best possible tools in the wrong
  hands are worthless. Perhaps even more important is how these individuals communicate with each other. The interactions between team members are what 
  helps them to collaborate and solve any problems that arise.
  
  **2-Working software:** previously, software developers would spend ages creating detailed documentation. That was before they even started writing a single
    line of code. And while documentation isn't a bad thing, there comes a point when you should focus on providing your customers with working software. The **Agile
    Manifesto** places shipping software to your customers as one of the highest priorities. You can then `gather feedback to helpy you improve futures releases`. 
    
 **3-Customer collaboration:** Once upon a time, contracts were king. You would draw up contracts with your customers who would then detail the finished product. 
     As a result, there was often a contrast between what the contract said, what the product did, and the customer actually required. According to the **Agile 
     Manifesto** the focus should be on continuous development. You need to build a `feedback loop with your customers`
     
**4-Responding to change:** can you imagine a time where you would draw up a roadmap and it would never change? Well, in the past that's exactly what happened.
    The trouble with `static roadmaps` is that we don't live in a static world. Needs and requirements are always shifting, and priorities are always changing. That
    `static roadmap` will soon grow outdated. That is why the **Agile Manifesto** suggests that a software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction 
    whenever they need to, with a flexible roadmap that reflects that. A `dynamic roadmap` can change from quarter to quarter, sometimes even month to month, and agile
    teams are able to keep up with those changes.
    
 ## The twelve Principles of Agile:

Along with the four values of the **Agile Manifesto**, there are 12 principles you need to be aware of. These principles go into a little more detail and expand
 upon the four values. 
 
 **1- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software:**
 It's always been important to keep your customers satisfied. It's easy for your customers to churn and find another product if they aren't happy.
 This agile principle encourages teams to shorten the gap between initial ideation and releasing a working product. The sooner customers can use your
 product, the sooner you can `collect feedback and make the appropriate improvements`
 
 **2- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage:**
 The only way to keep your head above water is to adapt. To do so, you need to constantly monitor any changing requirements no matter when they occur. Your need 
 to welcome the chance to further improve your product based on shifting market and customer needs 
 
 **3- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale:**
 The agile philosophy says consistently shipping new releases is a far better alternative to packaging all the releases up and releasing them at once.
 These smaller releases are foten the result of sprints, and they enable teams to validate ideas and gather feedback. They also help keep your customers satisfied. 
 
 **4- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project:**
Frequent communication between cross-functional teams ensures trust, transparency and as a result better and more relevant products. 

**5- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done:**
An agile team is only as good as its members. Take the time to build up a team of people you can trust to complete work of the highest quality.
If you have the right team in place, all you need to do is give them the right working environment and any support or resources they need. This removes
the need for hand-holding and micromanagement

**6- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation:**
Communication in real-time is essential when it comes to the fast pace of software development. There is nothing quite as effective as talking face-to-face.
Even in remote teams, video calling makes this easier than ever. 

**7- Working software is the primary measure of progress:**
Don't get distracted by detailed documentation or other vanity projects. Essentially, software teams have one job: to build and release working software. 
Focusing on this one measure of progress enables agile teams to work efficiently at shipping new releases. 

**8- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constante pace indefinitely:**
This Agile Manifesto principle explainw that sustainable development is important. This means ensuring a good work-life balance and maintain high morale throughout
the team. Doing so leads to output that is consistently high-quality. 

**9- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good deisgn enhances agility:**
The Agile Manifesto encourages teams to constantly release new features and updates to the product. Despite this, it also acknowledges 
the importance of maintaining quality in releases. 

**10- Simplicit-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential:**
Don't juggles development time across a wide range of irrelevant activities. The Agile Manifesto suggests that teams should spend the majority 
of their time on the few most important things. To do this, teams need to thing strategically and ruthlessly prioritize the features they work on. 

**11- The best architectures, requirements and design emerge from self-organizing teams:**
In traditional hierarchical teams, there will generally be somebody at the top of the chain making the final decisions. The Agile Manifesto encourages 
a less rigid chain of command. A flatter hierarchy, where everyone gets an equal say, can lead to more effective software development. 

**12- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly:**
One of the core tenets of the Agile Manifesto is that teams should always develop their products based on feedback. The same applies to the team's processes
and methodologies. As time goes on, teams should consider how they can become even more efficient and agile. It's all about continuous improvement.

## The Whole Team Approach in Agile Testing
In Agile, the **whole-team approach** means involving everyone with different knowledge and skills to ensure project success. The team includes representatives from the customer also known as the Product Owner, and other business stakeholders who determine product features.

The team should be relatively small, typically between five to seven, however, successful teams have been observed with as few as three people and as many as nine. Ideally, the whole team shares the same workspace and are sat as a group, as co-location strongly facilitates communication and interaction. 

The **whole team approach** is supported through the daily stand-up meetings involving all members of the team, where work progress is communicated and any impediments to progress are highlighted. The **whole team approach* promotes more effective and efficient team dynamics.
